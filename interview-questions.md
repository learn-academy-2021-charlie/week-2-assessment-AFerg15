# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is iteration?

  Your answer: I think of iteration as cycling through each value in an array and applying the action we are defining to manipulate the values by. For example, if I wanted to multiply each value in an array by 2, I would use the .map method to iterate through the array and return my array with values multiplied by 2.

  Researched answer: Iteration methods are those that operate on every array item and returns a new array. You can use these methods to manipulate, access and filter values in the array. 



2. The built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?

  Your answer: The .map() method is incredibly useful in working with arrays, I haven't committed the predefined parameters to memory yet, but I have several resources on using the .map() method bookmarked for quick access and can find that information for you. 

  Researched answer: The .map() method has three parameters available to it, value, index and array using a callback function which is required. This method iterates through an array performing an action and returns a new array without mutating the original array. 



3. What is object destructuring?

  Your answer: Object destructuring is used to take a property defined of the object and tie it to a variable. 

  Researched answer: Object destructuring allows you to extract a property from an object and tie it to a variable. You can extract multiple properties from an object using destructuring, including nested objects. This allows for cleaner code and prevents duplicating the property name. 



4. What is the difference between an object and a class?

  Your answer: A class is a blueprint for an object, and object is an instance of the blueprint defined by the class.

  Researched answer: A class is a blueprint for an object, and object is an instance of the blueprint defined by the class. A class defines object properties and behavior.



5. Why would you use the method super()?

  Your answer: You would use the method super() if you were creating a child class. 

  Researched answer: You would use the method super() if you were creating a child class. This method is used to access and call functions on an object's parent. 



6. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

  Your answer: Hoisting in JavaScript is when a value is hoisted up to the top of the current block of code.

  Researched answer: Hoisting is a default Javascript behaviour which moves all declarations to the top of the scope before the code is exevuuted. This provides an advantage as no matter where the functions or variables are declared they are brough up to the top of the scope whether global or local.



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. React: React allows developers to create large web applications that can change data, without reloading the page. The main purpose of React is to be fast, scalable, and simple.

2. React lifecycle methods: You can think of React lifecycle methods as the series of events that happen from the birth of a React component to its death. Every component in React goes through a lifecycle of events.

3. React state: The state is an instance of React Component Class can be defined as an object of a set of observable properties that control the behavior of the component. In other words, the State of a component is an object that holds some information that may change over the lifetime of the component.

4. Component invocation/call:

5. DOM Events: DOM (Document Object Model) Events are a signal that something has occurred, or is occurring, and can be triggered by user interactions or by the browser.
